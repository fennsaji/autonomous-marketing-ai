        self.client = hvac.Client(
            url=os.getenv('VAULT_ADDR'),
            token=os.getenv('VAULT_TOKEN')
        )
        
    def get_secret(self, path: str, key: str) -> str:
        try:
            response = self.client.secrets.kv.v2.read_secret_version(path=path)
            return response['data']['data'][key]
        except Exception as e:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Secret retrieval failed: {str(e)}")
```

### API security emphasizes rate limiting and comprehensive protection
