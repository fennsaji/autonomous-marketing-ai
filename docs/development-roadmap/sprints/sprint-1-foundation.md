## API Endpoints to Deliver

### Authentication Endpoints
```
POST   /api/v1/auth/register     # User registration
POST   /api/v1/auth/login        # User login
POST   /api/v1/auth/refresh      # Token refresh
POST   /api/v1/auth/logout       # User logout
GET    /api/v1/auth/me           # Current user profile
```

### System Endpoints
```
GET    /health                   # System health check
GET    /docs                     # API documentation
GET    /openapi.json             # OpenAPI specification
```

## Database Schema (Sprint 1)

### Users Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    hashed_password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    full_name VARCHAR(255),
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    is_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    
    -- Instagram integration fields (for future sprints)
    instagram_user_id VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    instagram_access_token TEXT,
    token_expires_at TIMESTAMP,
    
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_instagram_id ON users(instagram_user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_active ON users(is_active) WHERE is_active = true;
```

## Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Authentication utilities, password hashing, JWT functions
- **Integration Tests**: All API endpoints with database operations
- **Database Tests**: Model validation, constraints, relationships
- **Security Tests**: Authentication bypass attempts, input validation

### Test Data Management
- **Fixtures**: Reusable test data for consistent testing
- **Database Rollback**: Each test runs in isolated transaction
- **Mock Services**: External API calls mocked for reliability

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Database Connection Issues**
   - *Mitigation*: Connection pooling, health checks, retry logic
   
2. **Authentication Security**
   - *Mitigation*: Industry-standard bcrypt, secure JWT implementation, rate limiting
   
3. **Development Environment Complexity**
   - *Mitigation*: Docker Compose for consistent setup, detailed documentation

### Timeline Risks
1. **Learning Curve for New Technologies**
   - *Mitigation*: Allocate extra time for FastAPI/SQLAlchemy learning
   
2. **Testing Setup Complexity**
   - *Mitigation*: Start with basic tests, iterate on coverage
