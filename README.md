## ⚠️ Disclaimer

**This project is fully developed by Large Language Models (LLMs) as a demonstration of AI-powered software development capabilities. The entire codebase, architecture, documentation, and implementation have been generated through AI assistance without human coding intervention.**

This serves as an educational example of:
- **AI-Driven Development**: Complete software system designed and implemented by LLMs
- **Automated Code Generation**: Complex business logic and integrations created through AI
- **LLM Architecture Capabilities**: Understanding and implementing enterprise-level requirements
- **Modern Development Practices**: Applied through AI assistance (Docker, testing, documentation)

**Note**: While functional, this is a demonstration project showcasing AI development capabilities. It should be thoroughly reviewed, tested, and adapted before any production use.
